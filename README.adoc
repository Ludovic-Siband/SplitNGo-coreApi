== 🚀 Launch the project

=== 🔗 Connecting `bff` and `trip-api` via Shared Docker Network

To allow the `bff` service to communicate with the `trip-api` service across different repositories, we use a **shared external Docker network**.

This ensures proper service-to-service communication across containers, even when launched separately.

📦 1. Create the Shared Network

You only need to do this once on your machine:

```bash
docker network create splitngo-net
```

=== 🛠️ Development Mode (default)

The development mode uses `spring-boot-devtools` for hot reload.

[source,bash]
----
make dev
----

or directly:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up
----

=== 🚢 Production Mode

Builds and runs the JAR inside a container.

[source,bash]
----
make prod
----

or:

[source,bash]
----
BUILD_MODE=prod docker compose up
----

== 🧪 Manual Compilation

=== Build the application (without tests)

[source,bash]
----
make build
----

=== Clean the project

[source,bash]
----
make clean
----

== ⏹️ Stop the application

To stop and remove running containers:

[source,bash]
----
make down
----


== ⚙️ Spring Boot Configuration

The `application-dev.yml` file contains database settings for development.

Environment variables are injected via `.env`.

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  datasource:
    url: ${SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL}
    username: ${SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME}
    password: ${SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD}
----

== 📦 Environment Variables

Defined in a `.env` file (not versioned).
You can use `.env.example` as a template.

[source,env]
----
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=ChangeMe
MYSQL_DATABASE=ChangeMe
MYSQL_USER=ChangeMe
MYSQL_PASSWORD=ChangeMe

SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=ChangeMe
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=ChangeMe
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=ChangeMe
